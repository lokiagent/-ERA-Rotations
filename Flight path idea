“/run TaxiNodeName(slot)”- will be used in the following macro to provide a number for each flight path when talking to the flight master.

/run for node = 1, NumTaxiNodes() do print(node .. ": " .. TaxiNodeName(node)) end

“/run TakeTaxiNode(slot)”- will be used when you figure out what number your desired flight path is. Replace “slot” with the flight path number.

The following is an alternative method that was recommended, but I couldn’t get it to work.

For the following, replace “Grassy Cline” with the name of the place you want to go.

/run local n = "Grassy Cline"; for i=1, NUM_TAXI_BUTTONS do if TaxiNodeName(_G["TaxiButton"..i]:GetID()):lower():find(n:lower()) then TakeTaxiNode(i) return; end end PlaySound(47355);



-- Function to take a flight point by name
function TakeFlightPointByName(flightPointName)
    -- Convert the desired flight point name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    local desiredName = flightPointName:lower()

    -- Iterate through all taxi nodes
    for i = 1, NumTaxiNodes() do
        -- Get the name of the current taxi node and convert it to lowercase
        local nodeName = TaxiNodeName(i):lower()
        
        -- Check if the current node name matches the desired flight point name
        if nodeName:find(desiredName) then
            -- Take the flight to the matched node
            TakeTaxiNode(i)
            -- Optionally play a sound to confirm the action
            PlaySound(47355)
            return
        end
    end

    -- If no match is found, print a message
    print("Flight point not found: " .. flightPointName)
end

-- Example usage: Call the function with your desired flight point name
TakeFlightPointByName("Crossroads")
